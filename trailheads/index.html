As you know, I am a lucky lucky lucky luck boy. I am so thankful that we met and turned snapchat flirting at a hackathon into an amazing relationship. I can't believe it's been almost 2 years. I can't imagine what it would have been without you. Actually, I can. Way less Domino's. Anyway, as you know I'm bad at sentimental letters. I just want you to know that I love you so much, and that I can't wait to see you again (so soon) <3
<br/><br/>I'm sorry that I'm not able to celebrate with you in Pittsburgh for your 21<sup>st</sup> :-( I'm doubly sorry that my present will probably not be delivered in time for <a href="./ðŸŽ‰">their</a> birthday. I don't want to keep you in suspense, though, since I know how busy you are with orientation and everything. It's a pretty weird order, for sure. Definitely messed up my browser history ;-)
</p>
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CAROLINE!
